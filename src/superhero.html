    <h1>Superhero</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses supernatural
        or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains.
        A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although the
        word superhero is commonly used for females also. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such
        characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s.</p>
    <p>By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed superheroes.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>        While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed
        with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",<sup>[4]</sup> the longstanding Merriam-Webster
        dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally
        skillful or successful person".<sup> [5]</sup> Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked
        vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as
        superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits.</p>
    <p>Some superheroes use their powers to counter daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains,
        who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy.
        Some long-running superheroes such as Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the
        Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk have a rogues gallery of many villains.</p>

    <h3 id="his">History</h3>
    <h4>Early history</h4>
    <p>The word 'superhero' dates to at least 1917.<sup>[6]</sup> Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric heroes as Robin Hood,
        who adventured in distinctive clothing.<sup>[7]</sup> The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized the idea
        of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity.[7] Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp
        fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began
        appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character
        Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8] In the 1930s, both trends came together
        in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes such as Japan's Ōgon Bat[9][10] (visualized in painted panels
        used by kamishibai oral storytellers in Japan since 1931), Mandrake the Magician<sup>[11][12][13]</sup> (1934), Superman in
        1938 and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books.</p>

    <p>During the 1940s there were many superheroes: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted in this era. This era
        saw the debut of first known female superhero, writer-artist Fletcher Hanks's character Fantomah, an ageless ancient
        Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers to fight evil;
        she debuted in Fiction House's Jungle Comics #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to the pseudonymous "Barclay Flagg".<sup>[14][15]</sup>
        The Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime saboteurs using the superpower
        of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the eponymous syndicated newspaper comic strip a few months
        later on June 3, 1940.<sup>[16]</sup></p>

    <h3>Common traits</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Many superhero characters display the following traits:</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extraordinary powers or abilities. Superhero powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the ability to fly, enhanced
            senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like Batman, Mockingbird, the Phantom
            and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills such as martial arts, espionage techniques,
            and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree. Others rely on fantastical weapons or technology,
            such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed by Green Arrow
            and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers with a special weapon or device (e.g.
            Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating hammer, and Wolverine's
            adamantium claws).</li>
        <li>A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without expectation
            of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.</li>
        <li>A motivation, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man), an altruistic calling (e.g. Wonder Woman),
            a childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman), or a strong belief in justice and humanitarian
            service (e.g. Superman).</li>
        <li>A secret identity that protects the superhero's friends and family from becoming targets of his or her enemies, such
            as Clark Kent (Superman), or to protect themselves from getting arrested by the police, like Spider-Man, although
            many superheroes have a confidant (usually a friend or relative who has been sworn to secrecy). Most superheroes
            use a descriptive or metaphoric code name for their public deeds. However, there are also rare ones whose true
            identities are common public knowledge, even with a costumed identity (e.g. Iron Man and Captain America).</li>
        <li>A distinctive costume, often used to conceal the secret identity (see Common costume features).</li>
        <li>An underlying motif or theme that affects the hero's name, costume, personal effects, and other aspects of his or
            her character (e.g. Batman wears a bat-inspired costume, uses bat-themed equipment, and operates at night; Spider-Man
            can project artificial webbing from wrist-mounted web shooting gadgets, has a spider web pattern on his costume,
            and other spider-like abilities).</li>
        <li>A supporting cast of recurring characters, including the hero's friends, co-workers or love interests, who may or
            may not know of the superhero's secret identity. Often the hero's personal relationships are complicated by this
            dual life, a common theme in Batman, Spider-Man and Superman stories in particular.</li>
    </ul>
